# 🛍️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Online Store

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on an online retail dataset. The goal involves cleaning raw data, merging multiple data sources (events, products, and countries), and deriving actionable business insights regarding sales performance, profitability, shipment efficiency, and customer behavior.

## 📂 Dataset Structure
The analysis is based on three joined datasets:
1.  **Events:** Transactional data (Order ID, dates, units sold, costs).
2.  **Products:** Product details and categories.
3.  **Countries:** Geographical data.

Key features analyzed include: `Total Revenue`, `Total Cost`, `Total Profit`, `Shipment Time`, and `Sales Channel`.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and casting data types (DateTime conversions).
* **Feature Engineering:** Calculating metrics like *Total Profit* and *Shipment Time* (Ship Date - Order Date).
* **Sales Analysis:** Evaluating revenue and profit by product category and sales channel (Online vs. Offline).
* **Geographical Analysis:** Identifying top performing countries and regions (focus on Europe vs. Asia).
* **Time Series Analysis:** Visualizing sales trends over time and identifying seasonality.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas** (Data manipulation, merging, aggregation)
* **NumPy** (Numerical calculations)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization: Bar charts, Pie charts, Line plots, Scatter plots)

## 📊 Key Findings & Insights
Based on the analysis performed in the notebook:

### 1. Financial Performance
* **Top Categories by Revenue:** Cosmetics, Office Supplies, and Household items.
* **Profitability:** The highest profit margins are generated by Cosmetics and Household goods.
* **Sales Channels:** There is an almost even split between Online (49.9%) and Offline (50.1%) sales.

### 2. Regional Analysis
* **Dominant Market:** Europe accounts for **89.5%** of all sales.
* **Top Countries (Profit):** Ukraine, Malta, and Andorra.
* **Top Countries (Order Volume):** Romania, San Marino, and Andorra.

### 3. Logistics & Operations
* **Average Shipment Time:** ~25 days across all regions.
* **Fastest Shipping:** Personal Care products; Destination: UK & Croatia.
* **Slowest Shipping:** Cereal products; Destination: Hungary & Georgia.
* **Correlation:** No significant correlation was found between shipment time and total profit.

### 4. Seasonality & Trends
* **Weekly Trends:** Sales peak on **Monday, Saturday, and Sunday**, with the lowest activity on Thursday.
* **Category Dynamics:** Significant seasonal fluctuations observed in categories like Clothes and Office Supplies.

## 📈 Visualizations Included
The notebook contains various visualizations such as:
* **Bar Plots:** Revenue, Cost, and Profit by Category.
* **Pie Charts:** Sales Channel distribution and Regional splits.
* **Line Plots:** Sales dynamics over time (specifically for Europe, Ukraine, and specific categories).
* **Scatter Plot:** Relationship between Profit and Shipment Time.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3.  Place the source files (`countries.csv`, `events.csv`, `products.csv`) in the working directory.
4.  Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
